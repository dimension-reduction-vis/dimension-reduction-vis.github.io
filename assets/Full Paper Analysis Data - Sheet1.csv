In fact, by analyzing the vector lengths, we can also observe that CVA and MVA are approximately as dominant in the first component, while EPS and ROA are significantly more dominant than any of the other variables, in the second component. The angle between the vectors of a loading plot is related to the correlation between the original variables to which the loading vectors are associated. Figure 2 shows that CVA, MVA, EVA, and ROE are negatively correlated with SOL, ROA, EPS, and CFROI. Also, CVA and MVA are nearly uncorrelated with ROE since they form an angle greater than 90 degrees. Also, in the analysis of main components to facilitate the interpretation of these components, a procedure of axis rotation is used. This technique aims to obtain a correlation coefficient as low as possible on one or two main components. For numerical data, one of the most popular axis rotation techniques is the Varimax technique (Kaiser, 1958).""",,,,"""From the standardization methods presented by Freudenberg (2003) and OECD (2008), standardization transforms indicators on a common scale, with the mean 0 and the standard deviation 1""",,,
